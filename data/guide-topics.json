      "question": "What’s the fastest way to fix a broken IPTV EPG?",
      "answer": "Start by confirming your provider’s EPG URL, then verify it loads in a browser, add it to your player’s EPG section, and set a 12–24 hour refresh. If the grid is empty or offset, the fixes below target the most common XMLTV and timezone issues.",
      "highlight": "Most EPG failures are caused by incorrect XMLTV URLs or time offset settings."

    "intro": "Buffering is rarely just “slow internet.” It’s usually a mix of Wi‑Fi congestion, player buffer settings, ISP throttling, or stream mismatches. This cluster gives device‑specific fixes and network tuning steps that stabilize playback.",
    "quickAnswer": {
      "question": "What actually stops IPTV buffering?",
      "answer": "Use wired or 5 GHz Wi‑Fi, reduce stream bitrate to match your real bandwidth, and adjust buffer settings in your player. If issues persist, test with a VPN to rule out ISP throttling.",
      "highlight": "Stable bitrate + proper buffer settings beats raw speed in most IPTV setups."

      "question": "Why doesn’t catch‑up work on my IPTV?",
