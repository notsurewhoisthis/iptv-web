  "content": "# How to Set Up IPTV Catch-Up & Timeshift on All Devices: Complete Tutorial 2025\n\n## Quick Answer\nThis guide shows how to enable Catch-Up (provider archive) and Timeshift (live pause/rolling buffer) across Firestick, Android TV, iOS/Android mobile, Windows/macOS, and Linux (Tvheadend + FFmpeg). It includes exact app names (IPTV Smarters Pro 4.x+, VLC, Kodi 20.x), device models (Fire TV Stick 4K Max, Sony/Google TVs), full Tvheadend+FFmpeg scripts, systemd units, menu paths, troubleshooting commands, and optimization tips for reliable 2025 streaming.\n\n## Introduction\nCatch-Up and Timeshift are essential IPTV features in 2025. Catch-Up (a.k.a. TV Archive) lets you play previously aired content from your IPTV provider (usually 7–30 days depending on licensing). Timeshift creates a rolling live buffer you can pause, rewind, or resume in near-real-time independent of provider archives. Many users expect both: Catch-Up for on-demand viewing of past shows and Timeshift for pausing live sports or rewinding breaking news.\n\nThis tutorial covers both user-level setups (IPTV Smarters Pro, Kodi, VLC) and advanced self-hosted Timeshift with Tvheadend + FFmpeg (for channels without provider archives). You’ll get exact menu steps, app versions, system commands, service files, and troubleshooting tools (journalctl, ffmpeg logs). It’s aimed at home users who want reliable catch-up on Fire TV, Android TV, iOS/Android, Windows/macOS and tech-savvy users who want local timeshift server capability on Linux. Follow the sections in order: prerequisites, step-by-step setup for device types, advanced Tvheadend timeshift, troubleshooting, optimizations, FAQs, and conclusion.\n\n## Prerequisites / Requirements\n- IPTV subscription that supports catch-up (confirm with provider — often Premium/Ultimate tiers). Provider-side catch-up retention commonly 7 days; premium plans may extend to 14–30 days.\n- Network: minimum 15–20 Mbps for SD; 25+ Mbps recommended for HD/4K and multiple simultaneous streams. Wired Ethernet is strongly recommended for Timeshift servers.\n- Devices:\n  - Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K Max, or Fire TV Cube (Fire OS 7+).\n  - Android TV devices: Sony Bravia (Google TV), TCL, Hisense running Android TV 10+.\n  - Smart TVs (Tizen for Samsung, webOS for LG) often use native IPTV apps or sideload Android builds.\n  - Android phones/tablets (Android 11+), iPhone/iPad (iOS 15+).\n  - Windows 10/11 or macOS 11+ for desktop apps.\n  - Linux server for Tvheadend (Debian/Ubuntu recommended).\n- Software:\n  - IPTV Smarters Pro (v4.x+ for 2025) — primary consumer app for catch-up on most devices.\n  - Kodi 20.x (Nexus) with PVR IPTV Simple Client for alternative UI.\n  - VLC 3.x or higher for manual stream playback.\n  - Tvheadend 4.3+ on Linux (for advanced Timeshift).\n  - FFmpeg 6.x (or latest stable) for HLS segment generation.\n- Storage: For local Timeshift, reserve disk: 10GB+ minimum; 50–200GB recommended for multi-channel buffers and longer retention.\n- Permissions: sudo/root on Linux server.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\nNote: Start with your provider’s credentials (M3U URL, Xtream Codes/API) and confirm Catch-Up support. If provider supports catch-up, client-level setup is straightforward. If not, set up Tvheadend to create local Timeshift HLS feeds.\n\n1) Provider Check (5 minutes)\n   - Contact provider or check their dashboard. Ask:\n     - “Does my subscription include Catch-Up?” (Yes/No)\n     - “How many days of archive are available?”\n     - Obtain M3U URL and Portal/Xtream credentials. Copy precisely.\n\n2) Install IPTV Smarters Pro (common client)\n   - Firestick: Home > Search > type “IPTV Smarters Pro” > Select (Official) > Download (v4.x+ recommended). Open app.\n   - Android TV: Google Play Store > Search > IPTV Smarters Pro > Install. On TV choose “TV” UI.\n   - iOS/Android mobile: App Store / Google Play > install IPTV Smarters Pro (if not available, use “IPTV Smarters X” or official vendor app).\n   - Desktop: Download IPTV Smarters Desktop from official site for Windows/macOS (ensure you use 2025 build v4.x+).\n\n3) Add Playlist / Login (IPTV Smarters Pro)\n   - Launch app > “Add New User” > Choose “Load Your Playlist or File/URL”.\n   - Select “M3U/URL” or “Xtream Codes API”.\n   - Fill fields: Playlist name, M3U URL, username, password (if using Xtream). Example: Playlist name = “Home IPTV”, M3U URL = https://provider.example/m3u?token=xxxxx\n   - Tap “Add User” > Wait for channels to populate.\n   - If catch-up is supported by provider, channels that support it will show a \"Catch-Up\" or \"TV Archive\" icon.\n\n4) Accessing Catch-Up (IPTV Smarters)\n   - Open app > Channels or TV Guide.\n   - Long-press channel or press three-dot menu while highlighting a channel > Choose “Catch-Up / TV Archive”.\n   - Use calendar selector or left-arrow to navigate days within archive retention.\n   - Select program > Play.\n\n5) Pause Live TV / Timeshift (client-level)\n   - On supported streams, press the Pause button while watching live. The app will buffer using device storage or provider-side timeshift.\n   - Settings: App Settings > Player Settings > Enable “Pause Live” / “Allow Timeshift Buffer” > choose buffer size (if available).\n\n6) Alternative client: Kodi (for advanced users)\n   - Install Kodi 20.x on device.\n   - Add PVR IPTV Simple Client: Settings > Add-ons > My Add-ons > PVR Clients > PVR IPTV Simple Client > Configure > M3U URL or Playlist.\n   - To access Catch-Up requires provider to include catch-up within M3U or via XMLTV epggrab. Kodi’s interface allows Guide scrubbing and replay.\n\n7) Advanced Timeshift: Tvheadend + FFmpeg (self-hosted)\n   - Use when provider doesn’t support catch-up or for private local archive.\n\n   a) Server prep (Debian/Ubuntu):\n      - sudo apt update && sudo apt install tvheadend ffmpeg -y\n      - Create timeshift dir: sudo mkdir -p /timeshift && sudo chmod 777 /timeshift\n\n   b) FFmpeg HLS script (/home/lib/catch-up/timeshift_hls.sh):\n      - Create file with:\n        #!/bin/bash\n        /usr/bin/ffmpeg -reconnect 1 -reconnect_at_eof 1 -reconnect_streamed 1 -reconnect_delay_max 2 -y -nostdin -hide_banner -loglevel fatal \\\n        -i http://127.0.0.1:9981/stream/channelnumber/$1 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -scodec copy -g 60 -fflags +genpts -user_agent HLS_delayer \\\n        -metadata service_provider=\"TimeShift\" -f hls -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 360 -hls_wrap 361 \\\n        -hls_segment_filename /timeshift/$1_%03d.ts /timeshift/$1_hls.m3u8\n      - chmod +x /home/lib/catch-up/timeshift_hls.sh\n\n   c) systemd unit (/etc/systemd/system/timeshift_[CHANNEL].service):\n      - [Unit]\n        Description=Timeshift [Channel Name]\n        After=tvheadend.service\n        PartOf=tvheadend.service\n        Restart=always\n        [Service]\n        ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p /timeshift/\n        ExecStart=/home/lib/catch-up/timeshift_hls.sh [CHANNEL_ID]\n        ExecStop=/bin/rm -rf /timeshift/\n        [Install]\n        WantedBy=multi-user.target\n      - Replace [CHANNEL_ID] with numeric TVHeadend channel ID (e.g., 103).\n\n   d) Enable and start:\n      - sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n      - sudo systemctl enable timeshift_[CHANNEL]\n      - sudo systemctl start timeshift_[CHANNEL]\n      - Check: sudo systemctl status timeshift_[CHANNEL]\n\n   e) Configure Tvheadend mux to pipe HLS:\n      - Tvheadend admin UI (http://server-ip:9981) > Configuration > DVB Inputs > Muxes > Add New.\n      - Use pipe: pipe:///usr/bin/ffmpeg -live_start_index -99999 -i /timeshift/[CHANNEL_ID]_hls.m3u8 -c copy -f mpegts pipe:1\n      - In mux settings set “Input” to the pipe and disable \"Use A/V Library\".\n\n   f) Client usage:\n      - Add Tvheadend as PVR backend to Kodi or configure IPTV Smarters to load Tvheadend streams (use the stream URL: http://server-ip:9981/stream/channelnumber/[CHANNEL_ID]).\n\n8) Mobile and Desktop specifics\n   - Android: App Settings > Player > Enable “Hardware Acceleration” for better battery/CPU usage. Allow storage permission for timeshift/pause.\n   - iOS: Use official app or Safari with provider portal. iOS sandbox limits local buffering; prefer provider catch-up.\n   - Windows/macOS: IPTV Smarters Desktop > Settings > Advanced > Enable “Use System Player” or VLC as external player for stability.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n1) Catch-Up Not Showing\n   - Confirm provider supports Catch-Up and that your plan includes it.\n   - Refresh playlist: IPTV Smarters > Settings > Refresh Playlist or remove/add the M3U and re-add.\n   - Ensure app is updated: Firestick Settings > Applications > Appstore updates turned on; Play Store for Android.\n   - Timezone mismatch: Check device time & timezone: Settings > System > Date & Time.\n\n2) Timeshift Service Not Recording (Tvheadend)\n   - Check systemd status: sudo systemctl status timeshift_[NAME]. Look for ffmpeg exit errors.\n   - Inspect ffmpeg logs: sudo journalctl -u timeshift_[NAME] -n 200\n   - Disk full: df -h /timeshift — free space required. Clean segments: sudo rm -rf /timeshift/*\n   - Permissions: sudo chmod 777 /timeshift\n   - Channel URL change: verify /usr/bin/ffmpeg input URL (127.0.0.1:9981/stream/channelnumber/ID) works by wget or curl.\n\n3) Buffering / Stuttering\n   - Test network speed (Speedtest.net). If <25 Mbps for HD, reduce quality in app: Settings > Player Settings > Default Stream Quality.\n   - Use wired Ethernet or 5GHz WiFi. For Firestick use an Ethernet adapter (Amazon Ethernet Adapter).\n   - Router QoS: log into router > QoS/Priority > add IPTV device MAC/IP and set highest priority.\n\n4) Audio/Video Sync Problems\n   - Close and reopen stream; try a different player (VLC vs internal).\n   - In IPTV Smarters: Settings > Player Settings > Audio Offset > adjust ms.\n   - For Tvheadend re-encode audio or force sample rate with FFmpeg flags (advanced).\n\n5) Missing Episodes in Archive\n   - Often provider-side limitation or rights/licensing. Confirm with provider support and request server-side re-index or check their status page.\n\n6) App-specific crashes\n   - Clear app cache and data: Android Settings > Apps > IPTV Smarters > Storage > Clear Cache/Data.\n   - Reinstall app to the latest version. On Firestick, delete and reinstall.\n\n## Pro Tips and Optimization\n\n- Prioritize Devices with Wired Ethernet: Fire TV Cube and Android TV boxes with Ethernet deliver best stable timeshift performance. Use Gigabit Ethernet and avoid WiFi for server-client streaming.\n- Reserve Dedicated Disk and Partition for Timeshift: Use a separate 512GB SSD or NAS share mounted on /timeshift for multi-channel retention and increased lifespan. Use ext4 on Linux.\n- Use Router QoS and IGMP Proxy: Enable multicast/IGMP snooping if your provider uses multicast. In OpenWRT or DD-WRT enable IGMP proxy and set IPTV device priority.\n- Tune FFmpeg for Larger Buffers: In timeshift script increase -hls_list_size and -hls_time for coarser segmentation and fewer file handles. Example: -hls_time 15 -hls_list_size 720 for a 3-hour buffer when using fewer segments.\n- Use Hardware Acceleration: On Android TV/Firestick enable HW decoding (Settings > Player > HW+ decoder) to reduce CPU usage.\n- Monitor Logs and Disk Usage: Set a cron job to clean old segments automatically (find /timeshift -mtime +7 -delete) to maintain retention.\n- Test Stream Locally Before Automating: curl http://127.0.0.1:9981/stream/channelnumber/ID or open in VLC to verify stream path before starting systemd service.\n- For Remote Access: Protect Tvheadend with HTTPS and strong auth if exposing outside LAN; prefer VPN to access catch-up remotely.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nQ1: How many days of Catch-Up can I get?\nA1: That depends entirely on provider licensing. Standard packages often include 7 days. Premium tiers may offer 14–30 days. Confirm with your provider. If they don’t provide catch-up, use Tvheadend to create your own archive.\n\nQ2: Can I use Timeshift without a Linux server?\nA2: Limited client-side Timeshift exists (pause/rewind live) if the app and provider support it; this uses local device buffer and is constrained by device storage. For full multi-channel, long retention timeshift across devices, you need a server (Tvheadend + FFmpeg).\n\nQ3: Is IPTV Smarters Pro the only app that supports Catch-Up?\nA3: No. IPTV Smarters Pro is widely compatible and user-friendly. Alternatives: TiviMate (Android TV, premium catch-up features), Kodi with PVR clients, XCIPTV, OTT Navigator (Android), and native provider apps. Ensure the app version is updated—use IPTV Smarters v4.x+ for 2025 features.\n\nQ4: How much storage do I need for Timeshift?\nA4: Approximate: 1080p stream uses ~3–4 GB/hour; 720p ~1.5–2.5 GB/hour; 480p ~0.7–1.2 GB/hour. For a rolling 7-day single-channel buffer at 1080p, plan ~15–25 GB. Multiply by channel count if archiving multiple streams.\n\nQ5: Can I watch Catch-Up content on mobile away from home?\nA5: Some providers allow out-of-home viewing if their service permits external access. Tvheadend can be accessed remotely via VPN or securely exposed with HTTPS & auth, but beware provider T&Cs and copyright restrictions.\n\n## Conclusion\nSetting up Catch-Up and Timeshift for IPTV in 2025 ranges from simple app configuration (IPTV Smarters Pro, TiviMate, Kodi) to advanced self-hosted Timeshift with Tvheadend + FFmpeg that gives full local control. Start by confirming your provider’s catch-up capability and subscription tier, then use client apps for an easy experience. For channels without provider archives, follow the Tvheadend + FFmpeg steps to create HLS-based rolling buffers and use systemd to manage recording processes. Use wired networking, router QoS, and disk management to ensure stable playback. If you run into issues, check logs (journalctl, ffmpeg output), disk space, and app updates; most common problems are network or provider-side. With the configurations and troubleshooting steps above you’ll have a resilient catch-up and timeshift setup across Firestick, Android TV, iOS/Android, Windows/macOS, and Linux in 2025.",
