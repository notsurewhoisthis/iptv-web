  "content": "# IPTV Channel Logos Not Showing (2025) — Complete Troubleshooting & Setup Guide\n\n## Quick Answer\nMissing IPTV channel logos are usually caused by absent or broken `tvg-logo` entries in your M3U, broken image URLs, XMLTV vs M3U mismatches, or app-specific rendering bugs. Verify your M3U `tvg-logo` fields, test URLs in a browser or with curl/wget, clear app caches, and, if needed, use a middleware like Threadfin or Streamlink Manager (SLM) to normalize logos, rehost HTTPS images, and produce a cleaned M3U that your client can render.\n\n## Introduction\nChannel logos are core to a polished IPTV experience: they make channel lists readable, EPG grids useful, and DVR recordings easy to identify. However, because IPTV systems are a patchwork of playlist files (M3U), EPG files (XMLTV), third-party hosting, and client apps, logos frequently fail to appear. In 2025 several well-known issues persist: Plex's April 2025 app had a known rendering issue where Threadfin-supplied logos didn’t show in Plex iOS, Jellyfin 10.11 introduced a Live TV logo rendering problem, and many low-cost IPTV providers still serve unstable image hosting. Fixing logos requires a methodical approach: confirm the source (M3U vs XMLTV), validate image URLs, check client compatibility, clear caches, and optionally run a local micro-service to clean and rehost logos so every client sees the same reliable URLs.\n\nThis guide gives field-tested, step-by-step instructions to diagnose and fix missing logos across Channels DVR, Threadfin, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, NextPVR, Formuler, and other clients. You’ll get exact menu paths, text examples (like the `#EXTINF` format), commands to test URLs, and advanced options using Threadfin and Streamlink Manager. Whether you need a quick fix (clear cache, change guide source) or a robust production setup (local logo hosting, HTTPS rehosting, SLM automation), this tutorial covers all the practical steps and troubleshooting techniques.\n\n## Prerequisites / Requirements\n- Access to your IPTV M3U playlist file (URL or downloaded .m3u). You must be able to open it in a text editor.\n- If available, access to your provider’s XMLTV (EPG) file.\n- A device on the same network as your IPTV client for running server tools (Windows, macOS, Linux recommended).\n- Optional: A small always-on server (Raspberry Pi, NUC, or VPS) if you plan to host logos locally with Nginx or run Threadfin/SLM.\n- Basic familiarity with editing text files, copying URLs, and using a browser. Comfort with command-line (curl/wget) helps for deeper debugging.\n- IPTV client app knowledge: Channels DVR Server (macOS/Windows/Linux), Threadfin (server tool), Plex (iOS/Android/Web/Fire TV), Jellyfin (10.11+ noted issue), Emby, NextPVR, Formuler set-top boxes.\n\nHardware/software compatibility notes:\n- Formuler boxes require cache clearing after app changes: Home → Settings → Apps → [App] → Clear Cache.\n- Plex iOS (April 2025) had logo rendering bugs — test using a different client like Channels client, Emby, or NextPVR to isolate app-specific problems.\n- Jellyfin desktop/web clients may display logos while the mobile client does not — compare multiple clients.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide (Detailed, practical)\nThe following numbered steps move from quick checks to advanced fixes. Follow them in order.\n\n1. Inspect the M3U playlist for `tvg-logo` entries\n   - Download the .m3u file or open the provider URL in a browser and save to disk.\n   - Search for `tvg-logo` lines. Example:\n     #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id=\"bbc.one\" tvg-name=\"BBC One\" tvg-logo=\"https://images.example.com/logos/bbcone.png\" group-title=\"UK\",BBC One\n   - If logos are missing entirely, the provider didn’t include logos in M3U — move to step 5 (XMLTV/guide settings).\n   - If present, copy one `tvg-logo` URL for testing.\n\n2. Validate logo URLs from a device on your network\n   - Paste the `tvg-logo` URL into a browser. If it displays, it’s reachable.\n   - Use curl (Windows WSL/macOS/Linux):\n     curl -I \"https://images.example.com/logos/bbcone.png\"\n     - Confirm HTTP 200 and Content-Type (image/png or image/jpeg).\n   - If you see 404, 403, or connection timeout, the URL is broken or blocked.\n\n3. Check protocol: Prefer HTTPS\n   - Modern apps and devices block mixed content. If your `tvg-logo` uses `http://`, change to `https://` if available.\n   - If provider only offers HTTP, plan to rehost via Threadfin or local Nginx with HTTPS (see advanced steps).\n\n4. Test with alternate clients\n   - Load the same M3U into Channels DVR Server (Settings → Sources → Add M3U Source) and check channel list icons.\n   - Load into NextPVR (File → Add M3U Playlist), and check Channel Logos.\n   - If logos show in some clients and not others, it’s a client rendering issue (see app-specific fixes below).\n\n5. Check XMLTV guide integration\n   - Many providers include logos in XMLTV but not M3U. In Channels DVR, go to Settings → Sources → [Source] → Guide Data and ensure XMLTV is enabled and mapped.\n   - In Emby/Jellyfin, ensure your EPG XMLTV URL is entered under Live TV / TV Tuner settings and that “Use logos from guide” is enabled (Emby: Settings → Live TV → Guide; Jellyfin: Settings → Live TV → XMLTV).\n\n6. Clear caches and force refresh in your client\n   - Channels: Server → Settings → Sources → [Your Source] → Clear Cache; then Server → Restart.\n   - Formuler: Home → Settings → Apps → [Your IPTV App] → Clear Cache → Power off for 20 seconds → Power on.\n   - Jellyfin: Settings → Live TV → Channels → Refresh or restart Jellyfin server.\n   - Emby: Dashboard → Live TV → Guide → Refresh Guide Data.\n\n7. Use Threadfin to merge/sanitize feeds (recommended for multi-source setups)\n   - Install Threadfin on your server (Docker recommended). Add each M3U source and XMLTV file in the Threadfin web UI.\n   - Configure “Source Groups” per territory (US, UK, CA). Assign appropriate XMLTV guide per group.\n   - Under Output, enable “Include tvg-logo from XMLTV” and set “Rehost logos” to your server base URL (Threadfin can cache images).\n   - Generate a single output M3U and point your clients (Channels, Plex, Emby) at the Threadfin M3U URL.\n\n8. Use Streamlink Manager (SLM) for per-channel logo control\n   - Install SLM (Windows or Linux). Import your raw M3U.\n   - Use the SLM GUI to edit individual channel `tvg-logo` fields: upload a local image or paste a stable HTTPS URL.\n   - Export a cleaned M3U that references the rehosted images (SLM can run a local image server or generate files for Nginx).\n\n9. Rehost logos locally (Nginx) — sample minimal steps\n   - Create a directory /var/www/iptv-logos and place logos named by channel ID: bbcone.png, cnn.png.\n   - Install Nginx, serve /var/www/iptv-logos at https://iptv.local/logos/ (add SSL via Let's Encrypt if public).\n   - Update your M3U `tvg-logo` values to point at https://iptv.local/logos/bbcone.png\n   - Regenerate client caches and verify.\n\n10. Final verification and automation\n   - Confirm logos render in Channels (Server UI), Emby, NextPVR, and mobile clients after cache clear.\n   - Automate SLM or Threadfin to run hourly to revalidate and rehost images to prevent broken links.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n- Problem: Logos appear in setup screens but not in live TV/EPG grid\n  - Cause: App is sourcing logos from XMLTV for the grid and your M3U logos aren’t mapped.\n  - Fix: In Channels, go to Server → Sources → [Source] → Channel Mapping and enable “Prefer guide logos” or ensure your XMLTV includes <channel><icon src=\"...\"> entries. Use Threadfin to merge M3U and XMLTV icons.\n\n- Problem: Some logos show, others do not\n  - Cause: Inconsistent URL formatting (http vs https), file types, or missing files on host.\n  - Fix: Test each URL using curl/wget. Use SLM or Threadfin to standardize them. Convert HTTP-only images to HTTPS by rehosting.\n\n- Problem: Logos worked yesterday, missing today\n  - Cause: Image host outage or URL has changed/expired.\n  - Fix: Rehost locally or switch to a stable provider. If temporary, wait or use cached copy from Threadfin/SLM.\n\n- Problem: Logos disappear after EPG refresh\n  - Cause: Automatic EPG refresh overwrote manual logo edits.\n  - Fix: In Emby, disable automatic EPG updates: Dashboard → Live TV → Guide → Uncheck “Auto Update”. Maintain a backup of manual logos and reapply after refresh. Alternatively point Emby/Jellyfin to your rehosted image URLs so refresh won’t change them.\n\n- Problem: Jellyfin 10.11 shows channel list but no logos in Live TV\n  - Cause: Known rendering bug in Jellyfin 10.11.\n  - Fix: Roll back to a previous Jellyfin version (10.10.x) or manually upload logos: Settings → Live TV → Channels → Edit Channel → Upload Logo. Monitor Jellyfin release notes for a fix.\n\n- Problem: Plex iOS not showing Threadfin logos (April 2025)\n  - Cause: Plex app rendering bug specific to IPTV M3U outputs.\n  - Fix: Use an alternate client (Channels client, NextPVR, Emby) or use Plex web/Android app as a temporary workaround. Report to Plex support and keep Threadfin M3U available for other clients.\n\n- Problem: Custom logos reset in Emby after guide update\n  - Cause: Emby overwrites logos during metadata refresh.\n  - Fix: Export your Emby metadata backup, or host logos on an external stable URL (rehost with HTTPS) and use those links in Emby metadata. Reapply custom logos after critical updates.\n\n- Problem: Client blocks HTTP logos (mixed content)\n  - Cause: Client enforces HTTPS-only image loading.\n  - Fix: Rehost images under HTTPS. Use Let's Encrypt certificates for local Nginx or use a publicly hosted image CDN.\n\n## Pro Tips and Optimization\n- Standardize image size and format: Use PNG (preferred for transparency) at 200×200 px or 300×300 px, compressed to <50KB. Tools: ImageMagick (convert/resize/optimize) or online compressors.\n- Prefer HTTPS hosting: Configure Nginx with a valid TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt) or use a CDN with HTTPS. Modern clients often block mixed content.\n- Cache aggressively on server side: Configure Threadfin/SLM to cache images and set long Cache-Control headers to reduce client requests and speed up channel grid generation.\n- Group by territory: In Threadfin, create source groups per territory (US, UK, CA) and assign correct XMLTV guide to each group to avoid mismatched logos/EPG.\n- Minimize source count: Consolidate many M3U feeds into one optimized Threadfin output to reduce duplicate channels and conflicting `tvg-id` values.\n- Version control your M3U: Keep a copy of the raw provider M3U and your cleaned Threadfin/SLM M3U. If auto-updates break logos, revert quickly.\n- Automate validation: Schedule a cron job that curls each logo URL daily and logs failed images. Replace broken images automatically via SLM scripts or alert you to rehost.\n- Use M3U4U for favorites: Filter your large playlist to only your favorite channels (M3U4U) so clients load faster and you only need to fix fewer logos.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (4–5 common Qs)\nQ1: Should logos be in the M3U or XMLTV?\nA1: Ideally both. M3U `tvg-logo` entries are direct and immediate for playlist display. XMLTV contains guide-level icons and can fill gaps. Tools like Threadfin merge both sources so your client gets consistent icons regardless of which file it prefers.\n\nQ2: Can I use local file paths for logos?\nA2: Most IPTV clients require HTTP(S) URLs. Some server-side apps (Channels, Emby, Jellyfin) allow manual upload of a local image for a channel, but those files typically get stored by the server and may be overwritten by EPG updates. For consistent behavior across devices, rehost images via HTTPS (local Nginx or Threadfin/SLM rehosting).\n\nQ3: Why do logos appear in one app but not another?\nA3: Differences in how apps source logos (M3U vs XMLTV), security restrictions (HTTP blocked), caching behavior, and client-specific rendering bugs are the usual causes. Test with multiple clients (Channels, NextPVR, Emby) to isolate whether the issue is the playlist or the client.\n\nQ4: Will rebuilding my M3U fix logo problems?\nA4: Yes, rebuilding a cleaned M3U that uses stable HTTPS URLs for logos often resolves issues. Use Threadfin to merge and sanitize, or SLM to edit channel entries and export a cleaned M3U. Also ensure the client cache is cleared after swapping M3U sources.\n\nQ5: What size/format should channel logos be?\nA5: Use PNG for transparency, JPG if you need smaller sizes but no transparency. Aim for 200×200 px and under 50KB. If your client supports WebP and you control hosting, WebP can save bandwidth but is not universally supported by older IPTV clients.\n\n## Conclusion\nMissing IPTV channel logos are almost always solvable with a systematic approach: inspect your M3U for `tvg-logo` entries, validate each image URL, ensure HTTPS hosting, clear client caches, and use server-side tools like Threadfin or Streamlink Manager to normalize and rehost images. Client-specific bugs (Plex April 2025, Jellyfin 10.11) complicate matters but can often be worked around by switching clients or rolling back versions. For long-term reliability, rehost logos under your control (Nginx with TLS or Threadfin caching), standardize image formats and sizes, and automate URL validation. Follow the steps in this guide and you’ll restore a clean, logo-rich channel guide across Channels DVR, Emby, Jellyfin, Plex, NextPVR, Formuler boxes, and other IPTV clients. If a specific app still fails after you’ve confirmed the M3U/XMLTV and rehosted images, capture logs (app/server logs), test with curl/wget, and post the evidence to the app’s support forums — that information will usually produce a targeted fix quickly.",
