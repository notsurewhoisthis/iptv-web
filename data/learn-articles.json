        "content": "IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. In simple terms, it's a way to watch TV channels and videos through your internet connection instead of traditional cable or satellite.\n\nThink of it like Netflix or YouTube, but for live TV channels. Instead of signals coming through a cable wire or satellite dish, your TV shows arrive through the same internet connection you use for browsing websites."

This is why you can pause, rewind, or watch on-demand content."

Sports, news, and live events fall into this category.\n\n**2. Video on Demand (VOD)**\nWatch movies and TV shows whenever you want, like Netflix. You choose what to watch from a library of content.\n\n**3. Time-Shifted TV**\nWatch shows that aired earlier - catch up on programs you missed. Some services let you go back 24-72 hours."

        "content": "A codec (coder-decoder) compresses video for transmission and decompresses it for viewing. Without compression, a 1-hour HD video would be ~400GB - impossible to stream.\n\nCodecs make streaming possible by shrinking video files while maintaining quality. Your IPTV player needs to support the codec used by your streams."

        "answer": "Compatibility. H.264 works everywhere while H.265 requires newer hardware. Providers want maximum device support, so many stick with H.264. Also, H.265 encoding requires more processing power."
