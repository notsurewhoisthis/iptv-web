        "answer": "For standard definition: 3-5 Mbps. For HD (720p/1080p): 10-15 Mbps. For 4K/UHD: 25+ Mbps. These are per-stream requirements, so multiple TVs need more bandwidth."

        "answer": "TiviMate doesn't have native Chromecast support. Your options are: 1) Screen mirror from your phone, 2) Install TiviMate directly on Chromecast with Google TV, or 3) Use a different IPTV app with casting support like GSE Smart IPTV."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my cast keep disconnecting?",
        "answer": "Usually caused by Wi-Fi issues or phone going to sleep. Keep your phone awake during casting, ensure strong Wi-Fi signal, and try moving closer to your router."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is screen mirroring quality as good as native casting?",
        "answer": "No, native casting sends video directly to Chromecast in full quality. Screen mirroring compresses and sends your screen, which can reduce quality and introduce slight delay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cast from iPhone to Chromecast?",
        "answer": "Chromecast doesn't support native iPhone screen mirroring. Use apps with built-in Chromecast support, or use third-party mirroring apps. For best results with iPhone, consider Apple TV with AirPlay instead."

        "question": "What's the difference between Chromecast and Chromecast with Google TV?",
        "answer": "Original Chromecast only receives casts from your phone - it can't run apps. Chromecast with Google TV has a full interface and Play Store, so you can install IPTV apps directly without casting."
