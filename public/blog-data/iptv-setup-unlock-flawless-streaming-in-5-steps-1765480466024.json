You stream shows and channels through your internet connection instead of traditional cable or satellite systems.\n\nIPTV uses streaming protocols like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), and Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). These protocols adjust video quality based on your internet speed. When your connection slows down, the video quality drops to prevent buffering. When your speed improves, quality increases again.\n\n## Device Compatibility and Hardware Requirements\n\nIPTV works on most modern devices.
