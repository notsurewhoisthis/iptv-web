    "content": "## What Stremio is (in one sentence)\nStremio is a media center that organizes movies, series, live channels, and your library in one place using catalogs and addons.\n\n## How Stremio works (simple explanation)\nStremio has three parts:\n1) **The app** (player + library + search)\n2) **Catalogs** (what you can browse)\n3) **Addons** (connect catalogs to sources and features)\n\nStremio itself does not “own” content. What you can watch depends on the addons you choose and the services you’re signed into.\n\n## The safe way to use Stremio\nUse Stremio with:\n- **Official streaming services** you subscribe to (where supported)\n- **Public domain / free-to-watch catalogs**\n- **Your own local files** (personal media library)\n\nAvoid any addon that claims to unlock paid channels/movies for free. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.\n\n## Quick setup checklist\n- Create/sign in to your Stremio account\n- Install Stremio on your device(s)\n- Add only addons you trust and understand\n- Test playback with a known-legal title\n- If you hit errors, use the troubleshooting guides on this site\n\n## Helpful next steps on IPTV Guide\n- Stremio player overview: [Stremio review](/players/stremio)\n- Device setup guides: [Stremio setup guides](/guides/stremio/setup/firestick)\n- Troubleshooting hub: [Stremio troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/players/stremio/stremio-internal-server-error)\n",

Use an **IPTV player** when you have an **M3U** or **Xtream** playlist and want channel-first navigation.\n\n## What IPTV players are best at\nIPTV players are purpose-built for:\n- M3U playlists and Xtream portals\n- Channel lists, EPG (TV guide), catch‑up, and favorites\n- Fast channel switching and buffer controls\n\nTry these on IPTV Guide:\n- [VLC](/players/vlc)\n- [Kodi](/players/kodi)\n- [IPTV Smarters](/players/iptv-smarters)\n\n## What Stremio is best at\nStremio shines for:\n- Browsing a library-style catalog (movies/series)\n- Syncing watch progress across devices\n- A clean, modern interface for media discovery\n\n## Common confusion: “Can I use IPTV with Stremio?”\nStremio isn’t a traditional IPTV app and doesn’t directly take M3U/Xtream. If your goal is IPTV channels + EPG, you’ll have a better experience with a dedicated IPTV player.\n\n## Where “legal IPTV” fits\nIf you’re looking for **free, publicly available playlists**, start here:\n- [Public playlists directory (iptv-org)](/legal-iptv)\n\nThen open the playlist in an IPTV player (VLC/Kodi/TiviMate).\n",
